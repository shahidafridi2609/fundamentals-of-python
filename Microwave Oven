A microwave oven manufacturer recommends that when heating two items, add 50% to the heating time, and when heating three items double the heating time. 
Heating more than three items at once is not recommended. Write a program that asks the user for the number of items and the single-item heating time.
The program then writes out the recommended heating time.

Sample Input and Output 1:
Enter the number of items
2
Enter the single item heating time
5.0
The recommended heating time is 7.50

Sample Input and Output 2:
Enter the number of items
4
Enter the single item heating time
5.0
Number of items is more
 
program:
a=int(input(""))
b=float(input(""))
print("Enter the number of items")
print("Enter the single item heating time")
if a==2:
    c=b+b*0.5
    print('The recommended heating time is %.2f'%c)
elif a==3:
    c=b+b*2
    print('The recommended heating time is %.2f'%c)
else:
    print("Number of items is more")
