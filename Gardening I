Dora is interested so much in gardening and she plants more trees in her garden.
She plants trees in a rectangular fashion with the order of rows and columns and numbered the trees in row-wise order.
She planted the mango tree only in a 1st row, 1st column and last column.

program:
r=int(input())
c=int(input())
t=int(input())
if(t<=c):
    print("Yes")
elif(t%c==0) or (t%c==1):
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
