Ajay, Binoy and Chandru were very close friends at school. They were very good in Mathematics and they were the pet students of Emily Mam. Their gang was known
as 3-idiots. Ajay, Binoy and Chandru live in the same locality. A new student Dinesh joins their class and he wanted to be friends with them. He asked Binoy about
his house address. Binoy wanted to test Dinesh's mathematical skills. Binoy told Dinesh that his house is at the midpoint of the line joining Ajay's house and
Chandru's house. Dinesh was puzzled. Can you help Dinesh out? Given the coordinates of the 2 end points of a line (x1,y1) and (x2,y2), write a python program 
to find the midpoint of the line. 

Sample Input:
 2
 4
 10
 15

Sample Output:
Binoy's house is located at (6.0,9.5)

program:
x1=int(input())
y1=int(input())
x2=int(input())
y2=int(input())
a=(x1+x2)/2
b=(y1+y2)/2
print("Binoy's house is located at",(a,b),)
